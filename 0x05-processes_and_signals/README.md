# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Project Overview
This project focuses on understanding and manipulating Linux processes and signals through various Bash scripts. The scripts demonstrate the creation, management, and termination of processes and how signals can be used to control these processes dynamically.

## Objectives
- Understand how processes are handled in Linux.
- Learn how to send signals to processes and handle those signals within scripts.
- Create Bash scripts that can manage processes and react to signals gracefully.

## Setup
To run the scripts in this project, you will need a Linux environment with Bash installed. You can clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone [URL_of_the_repository]
cd 0x05-processes-and-signals
